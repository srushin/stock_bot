## Overview
    Try to predict stock price for (insert specific stock tickers/names here) using structured machine learning focused on volume and moving average.

    Try to classify and identify how r/wallstreetbets/ affects stock price and are the number of posts a major factor on the performance of (insert specific stock tickers/names here).

    Data Constraints: 
        -Bound time to the last 5 years 
        -Focused on close prices 
        -Daily time frame 
        -Top 5 Volume traded stocks (GME,AMC,CLOV,CLNE)

# Tools
      -Github(Version Control) 
      -ETL(Python/JS, Dataframes/JSON, Prostgre{AWS,?}) (ERD) 
      -Structured Machine Learning(Python) Prediction** 
      -Unstructured ML (Python) Classification 
      -Dashboard(Tableau)

      ETL (Drake/Group)
    Price: Kaggle Volume: Kaggle Moving Average: Daily calculation of price from Kaggle data Reddit: API call (i'll try to dig into how to make this call and write a sample script for next week {Chris})

    ML(Lisette/Group)
    Prediction Model: Structured ML (Which factor can predict stock price the best? (Volume, Moving average, Number of reddit posts?, Other Indicator?)) Are we going to use Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Other? Classification: Unstructured ML # of Reddit mentions (need to talk about this one further)

## Questions
    Look at # of shorts for a given year?
    What key indicators affect stock price the most? (Volume, Moving Average, RSI**, VWAP**)
    How stocks perform vs industry average?
    How specific stocks perform against general market?
    How does # of reddit posts on Walstreet Bets affect the performance against specific stocks?
